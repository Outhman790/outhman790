## 🚀 About Me

🎓 Ever since I was a kid, I was the kind of person who would take things apart just to see how they worked — and try to put them back together (sometimes successfully 😅). Whether it was modifying games, building simple websites, or experimenting with scripts, the urge to build has always been in me.

Today, that same curiosity drives my journey as a **self-taught fullstack developer**, strengthened by my time at **Solicode**, a development school where I honed essential soft skills like **communication**, **collaboration**, **project planning**, **problem-solving**, **adaptability**, and **time management** — all developed through team-based coding projects, agile workflows, and presentations under real deadlines. I taught myself the entire **frontend ecosystem**, from HTML/CSS/JS to advanced React patterns. During my time at **Solicode**, I deepened my backend knowledge by working with **PHP** and **MySQL**, gaining a solid foundation in server-side logic and relational databases. After graduating, I kept pushing forward by diving into modern stacks like **Node.js** and **Express**, where I now build powerful REST APIs and scalable backend systems.


With 27+ projects under my belt — from simple PHP apps to fullstack systems — I’ve built strong skills in **REST API design**, **authentication**, **database modeling**, and clean, component-driven UI architecture. I love turning Figma designs into production-ready code with high accuracy, whether it's with TailwindCSS or raw CSS.

🧠 My current obsession is mastering **DevOps**: automating deployment pipelines, managing cloud infrastructure, and scaling apps smartly using AWS services.

## 🔭 Current Focus & Next Goals

- 🚧 Finalizing **OGallery**, a fullstack image-sharing app with real-time features, admin tools, and AWS deployment
- 🌐 Deepening DevOps skills: **Nginx**, **CI/CD pipelines**, **Auto Scaling Groups**, and **Terraform**
- 🐳 Learning **Docker** for containerization and exploring **Kubernetes** for orchestration
- 🎯 Preparing for **AWS Developer Associate Certification**
- 📦 Building personal boilerplates for reusable, production-ready fullstack setups
- 🧪 Getting hands-on with testing: writing unit tests, integration tests, and E2E flows


🛠️ I'm not just coding — I'm focused on writing **clean, scalable, performant, and maintainable code** across both frontend and backend.

📚 I believe in **building consistently, sharing openly**, and improving every week.  

🛠️ Currently creating my personal portfolio and polishing all of my GitHub projects with full READMEs, demos, and clean deployment setups.

Let’s connect and build cool things 🚀
